## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 16.5.24

Working on my DataBase version 1.

![Database v1](images/Database_v1.png)

I have worked on my database, i have gotten the car table and have gor 2 columns in so far 'Make' and 'Model', i have got the Sightings table done as well, the table has: id, Car.id, Date_time, and Location.

> If i was looking at spotting a car, some of the details i would like to know would be, what colour, what year, how many owners (if possible), kilometers travelled (if possible), and condition inside and out.

Database version 2.

I have followed my clients advice and have added more columns into my database table that have the names of what my client stated.


### 20.5.24

I am working on my User Interface design version 1.

![UI design v1](images/UI_design_v1.png)

I have made a outline of what my ui design could be, when the client opens up the website indicated by the word 'Start', they will be sent directly to a list of previously spotted cars, from there, there could be a add button to add a new car sighting to the site and a cancel button if they need to revert out of the new sighting page. When my client clicks/taps on a previously sighted car, it would come up with the car details.

>I suggested to add another box and make that a watchlist.

I listened to my clients advice and added another box and arrow which says 'Watchlist'.



### 21.5.24

I have done some minor changes to my UI flow design.

I have tweaked the colour of my boxes and i have added more arrows showing how the3 user will be able to get back out of the car details page and the watchlist page, i have also added a submit arrow for when a new car sighting is ready to be added.
