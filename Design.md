Project Name: **Car Spotting Website**

Project Author: **Jayarn Sheridan**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Car Enthusiasts/spotters are always looking out for cars weather its normal family 4-doors to 2-door sport cars. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cars that go by as they are all in different shapes, colours and are at different speeds meaning it may be hard to identify them. A website that could help the user keep track of the cars would be useful.

### End-User Requirements

The typical end-users that would use this website would be people that like cars, their specific needs could include an easy to use website, simple language, and good aesthetics - fonts, colours etc.

### Proposed Solution

A website that need to record sightings of different cars that the client would have seen. The site should be able to: View the recorded sightings of cars, add car sightings to the site, delete any unwanted sightings, add a new car to the site.
