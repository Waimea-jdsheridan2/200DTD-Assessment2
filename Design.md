# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Car Spotting Website**

Project Author: **Jayarn Sheridan**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Car Enthusiasts/spotters are always looking out for cars weather its normal family 4-doors to 2-door sport cars. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cars that go by as they are all in different shapes, colours and are at different speeds meaning it may be hard to identify them. A website that could help the user keep track of the cars would be useful.

### End-User Requirements

The typical end-users that would use this website would be people that like cars, their specific needs could include an easy to use website, simple language, and good aesthetics - fonts, colours etc.

### Proposed Solution

A website that need to record sightings of different cars that the client would have seen. The site should be able to: View the recorded sightings of cars, add car sightings to the site, delete any unwanted sightings, add a new car to the site.

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implication means the user interface of the website, these could include following standard conventions, making the behaviour logical and familiar, providing the end-user with a clear route forwards, and always making it obvious to the end-user what is happening. 

This implication is relevant to my major project because i need this website to be friendly to use, the people that use this site may not be very good at computer skills so i have to make it so the user knows and understands what is happening.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

### Functionality

The functionality implication means does the website run?, is everything in working order?, does it meet the end-users purpose?, this implication should fully satisfy the original need / purpose, fully meet the users requirements, and make sure that it copes with all inputs.

This implication is important to my website as it shows that the website runs, i need to make the site run, have it run in working order and it needs to fully satisfy the clients need / purpose.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

###  Aesthetics

The aesthetics implication means does it look good, does it have good colour and fonts? this implication should create an overall design that appeals to the end user, use colours that work effectively together to achieve a pleasing effect, and position items in a way that is balanced.

This implication is relevant to my project because i want my website to be appealing towards the user, i need to make sure that it looks good, has good fonts, and has an appropriate colour scheme that has similar colours for each page.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

###  End-Users

The end-users implication means does it meet the users specific needs, this implication should know as much as possible about your end-user

This implication is important for my website because

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
