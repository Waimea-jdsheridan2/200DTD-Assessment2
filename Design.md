# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Car Spotting Website**

Project Author: **Jayarn Sheridan**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Car Enthusiasts/spotters are always looking out for cars weather its normal family 4-doors to 2-door sport cars. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cars that go by as they are all in different shapes, colours and are at different speeds meaning it may be hard to identify them. A website that could help the user keep track of the cars would be useful.

### End-User Requirements

The typical end-users that would use this website would be people that like cars, their specific needs could include an easy to use website, simple language, and good aesthetics - fonts, colours etc.

### Proposed Solution

A website that need to record sightings of different cars that the client would have seen. The site should be able to: View the recorded sightings of cars, add car sightings to the site, delete any unwanted sightings, add a new car to the site.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implication means the user interface of the website, these could include following standard conventions, making the behaviour logical and familiar, providing the end-user with a clear route forwards, and always making it obvious to the end-user what is happening. 

This implication is relevant to my major project because i need this website to be friendly to use, the people that use this site may not be very good at computer skills so i have to make it so the user knows and understands what is happening.

Moving forward i will need to consider how friendly my UI will be for my client i will make it follow standard conventions, i will make the UI in a way that will be easy to use, clients should be able to see what part of the website they are working on with ease.

### Functionality

The functionality implication means does the website run?, is everything in working order?, does it meet the end-users purpose?, this implication should fully satisfy the original need / purpose, fully meet the users requirements, and make sure that it copes with all inputs.

This implication is important to my website as it shows that the website runs, i need to make the site run, have it run in working order and it needs to fully satisfy the clients need / purpose.

When moving forward i will need to consider how my website functions, i will make it so that it functions properly and it does what my client intends it to do. when my client clinks on link to other parts of the site, it should do it and show what the link is intended to do.

###  Aesthetics

The aesthetics implication means does it look good, does it have good colour and fonts? this implication should create an overall design that appeals to the end user, use colours that work effectively together to achieve a pleasing effect, and position items in a way that is balanced.

This implication is relevant to my project because i want my website to be appealing towards the user, i need to make sure that it looks good, has good fonts, and has an appropriate colour scheme that has similar colours for each page.

Moving forward, i will need to consider my colours for my website, i will make my colours follow standard conventions and have it relate to a theme of cars and spotting things, i should have appropriate colours that are not too in your face but not too dull either.

###  End-Users

The end-users implication means does it meet the users specific needs, this implication should know as much as possible about your end-user

This implication is important for my website because it should meet my end users intentions, it should make the end user add a car sighting to the sight an dit should help the end user in the site.

Moving forward i will need to consider how my site will meet my end users expectations, i will make my site so that it knows what the end user wants and will do what the end user needs, i will make it so that the site will not interfere with what my end user wants by allowing the client to do what they want for the site.

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
